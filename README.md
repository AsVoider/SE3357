## Lab0: Bomb
This lab is inspired by CSAPP which designs a bomb lab for x86/x86-64.

Differently, our lab is for getting familiar with ARM assembly and getting prepared for the following kernel labs on ARM/Raspi.

## Lab1: Kernel Boot
This lab explains how to set the CPU exception level, configure the kernel page table, and enable MMU during kernel boot.
We will use a basic version of [ChCore microkernel](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/gu) in the series of kernel labs and the experiment machine is Raspi3b+ (both QEMU and board are OK).
